      "contents": "\nWhen do we need to RSVP?\nRSVP by August 31, thank you!\nWhat should we wear?\nThanks to all of you who have helped us with our dress code questions. Friday and Sunday are casual events, with the option of getting in the ocean Sunday.\nFor the ceremony and reception Saturday we want you to be comfortable, and also hope you’ll take this as an excuse to dress up a little bit in whatever way is fun for you! The event is outside so it may be hot in the afternoon sun and chilly by the end of the evening. A dress of any length, jacket and pants, suit, jumpsuit, button down shirt, or skirt/sweater would all be lovely. We’re imagining a treehouse/garden/dressy casual event.\nThere are some areas of uneven ground, stairs, and grass at the ceremony/reception location so we recommend flat shoes or at least wide heels!\nWhere are good places to stay?\nAnywhere between Goleta and Carpinteria will be beautiful and convenient for the weekend! Check out our hotel list or travel page for more ideas.\nWhat is the weather like?\nThe weather in Santa Barbara is great.\nIn October, we expect late afternoon highs in the mid-70s and nighttime lows in the upper 50s. The air is relatively dry and there can be a bit of coastal fog, so it cools off quickly once the sun goes down.\nFor the ceremony and reception on Saturday, we will be outdoors in a park. We are planning to set up some heat lamps, but consider a warm layer for the later evening especially if you get cold easily!\nCan we park at the wedding?\nYes! Saturday and Sunday locations both have free parking lots. Friday’s welcome party is in the Funk Zone neighborhood, which does have free street parking but can be a bit busy on weekend nights. There are reasonably priced parking lots and decks throughout downtown.\nPlease drive safely and consider using rideshare, renting ebikes, or taking MTD buses!\nWhat about cascarones?\nCascarones are STRICTLY forbidden at Elings Park.\n\n\n\n",
