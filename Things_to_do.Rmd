## Get to know the area
Here are a few places to get you oriented + consider visiting when you are around.

* Goleta (The Goodland) - surrounding the UCSB campus between the ocean and mountains, Goleta is the town where we first met and lived together! Lots of beautiful parks, beaches, and neighborhoods

* Downtown/waterfront SB - worth walking up and down State Street to the beach and pier, and through the Funk Zone (neighborhood with lots of art galleries and bars/breweries/wineries)

* Montecito - just south of Santa Barbara, where celebrities live

* Solvang - a town up the 101 that, for whatever reason, is Danish themed. Also close to wine country in the Santa Ynez valley.
